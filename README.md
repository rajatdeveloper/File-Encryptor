Securing Computer Files using Bluetooth and Rijndael Encryption
Security of the computer files and folders have been a core issue ever since the advent of the windows. Passwords were then introduced to solve this issue but they themselves lend a host of disadvantages. In this we can tackle that advantages where we propose a Two Factor Authentication [T-FA] system utilizing Bluetooth as a factor coupled with the powerful Rijndael Encryption Algorithm. Bluetooth is the most commonly used technology for Point to Point short range of communication of devices. Besides from being commonly used, it also offers multi connection. Rijndael algorithm is an Advanced Encryption standard, believed to be the most effective encryption and decryption cryptographic algorithm. Its minimum 10 rounds of encryption and variable key size with a minimum of 128 bits makes it difficult to crack. Coupling the widespread accessibility of Bluetooth and powerful encryption of Rijndael, a Two Factor Authentication System [T-FA] can be created which will not only efface the disadvantages of passwords, but also create a user friendly security system.
